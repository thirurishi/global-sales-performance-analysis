📊 Global Sales Performance Analysis & Executive Dashboard


Overview

This project is an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow that analyzes retail sales performance using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
It simulates a real-world business analytics environment — starting from raw data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL-based KPI computation, and ending with a two-page executive dashboard for decision-making.
The primary goal of this project is to generate actionable business insights rather than focus on machine learning.
